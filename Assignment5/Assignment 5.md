# Assignment 5

**(total 70 points)**

## Exercise 1: File I/O 

**(20 points)**

### Prerequisites, Goals, and Outcomes
**Prerequisites:** Before you begin this exercise, you need mastery of the following:

- _Java API_
  - Knowledge of the class `StringTokenizer`
- _File I/O_
  - Knowledge of file I/O
    - How to read data from a file
    - How to write data to a file

**Goals:** Reinforce your ability to use file I/O

**Outcomes:** You will master the following skills:

- Produce applications that read data from a file and parse it
- Produce applications that write data to a file

### Background
This assignment asks you to implement two methods: one that reads employee data from a file and another that writes employee data to a file. The employee data contains basic information (ID, name, and salary) for a collection of employees.
### Description
In this assignment, you will finish the implementation of `EmployeeFileIO`. iCarnegie will provide a test driver and the class `Employee`.
#### Class `Employee`

A complete implementation of this class is included in the student archive [_student-files.zip_](https://www.icarnegie.com/content/SSD/SSD3/4.2.0.0/normal/pg-adv-class-impl/pg-io-prgrmng/assm-qz-pr-file-io/pool-pr-file-io/qn-pr-io-empl/handout/student-files.zip). Stop _now_ and review its documentation:
- [_Employee.html_](https://www.icarnegie.com/content/SSD/SSD3/4.2.0.0/normal/pg-adv-class-impl/pg-io-prgrmng/assm-qz-pr-file-io/pool-pr-file-io/qn-pr-io-empl/handout/Employee.html). Documentation for class `Employee`

#### Class `EmployeeFileIO`

A partial implementation of this class is included in the student archive [_student-files.zip_](https://www.icarnegie.com/content/SSD/SSD3/4.2.0.0/normal/pg-adv-class-impl/pg-io-prgrmng/assm-qz-pr-file-io/pool-pr-file-io/qn-pr-io-empl/handout/student-files.zip). You should complete the implementation of the following methods:
- `public static ArrayList<Employee> read(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException, NoSuchElementException, NumberFormatException`

  This method creates an `ArrayList` of `Employee` objects from a file that contains employee data.

- `public static void write(String fileName, ArrayList<Employee> arrayList) throws IOException`

  This method creates a file of employee data from an `ArrayList` of `Employee` objects.
#### Class `TestEmployeeFileIO`
This class is a test driver for `EmployeeFileIO`. It contains test cases for each method in `EmployeeFileIO`. A complete implementation is included in the student archive [_student-files.zip_](https://www.icarnegie.com/content/SSD/SSD3/4.2.0.0/normal/pg-adv-class-impl/pg-io-prgrmng/assm-qz-pr-file-io/pool-pr-file-io/qn-pr-io-empl/handout/student-files.zip). You should use this class to test your implementation of `EmployeeFileIO`. Your implementation of method `read` is tested by comparing the `ArrayList` returned by your implementation against an `ArrayList` returned by the *iCarnegie* implementation. In the same way, your implementation of method `write` is tested comparing the file produced by your implementation against a file produced by the *iCarnegie* implementation.
#### Class `TestHelper`
This class contains auxiliary methods used by the test driver: a method for comparing two `ArrayList` objects and a method for comparing two files. A complete and compiled implementation is included in the student archive [_student-files.zip_](https://www.icarnegie.com/content/SSD/SSD3/4.2.0.0/normal/pg-adv-class-impl/pg-io-prgrmng/assm-qz-pr-file-io/pool-pr-file-io/qn-pr-io-empl/handout/student-files.zip).Review its documentation and become familiar with it:
- [_TestHelper.html_](https://www.icarnegie.com/content/SSD/SSD3/4.2.0.0/normal/pg-adv-class-impl/pg-io-prgrmng/assm-qz-pr-file-io/pool-pr-file-io/qn-pr-io-empl/handout/TestHelper.html). Documentation for class `TestHelper`

### Files
The following files are needed to complete this assignment:
- [_student-files.zip_](https://www.icarnegie.com/content/SSD/SSD3/4.2.0.0/normal/pg-adv-class-impl/pg-io-prgrmng/assm-qz-pr-file-io/pool-pr-file-io/qn-pr-io-empl/handout/student-files.zip) â€” Download this file. This archive contains the following:
  - Class files
    - _TestHelper.class_
  - Documentation
    - _Employee.html_
    - _TestHelper.html_
  - Java files
    - _Employee.java_. A complete implementation
    - _TestEmployeeFileIO.java_. A complete implementation
    - _EmployeeFileIO.java_. Use this template to complete your implementation.
  - Data files used by the test driver
    - _empty.txt_. An empty file
    - _employees.txt_. A file with employee data

### Tasks
Implement the methods `read` and `write` in class `EmployeeFileIO`. Document your code using Javadoc and follow Sun&#39;s code conventions. The following steps will guide you through this assignment. Work incrementally and test each increment. Save often.
1. **Extract** the files from student-files.zip

2. **Test** each method as soon as you finish writing it by issuing the following command at the command prompt:

   ```powershell
   C:\>java TestEmployeeFileIO
   ```

3. **Implement** the method `read` **(10 points)**: 

   It begins by creating an empty `ArrayList` and a `BufferedReader` object to read data from the specified file. It then proceeds to read each line in the file. After it reads a line, it extracts the ID, name, and salary of an employee, creates an `Employee` object, and adds the new object to the end of the `ArrayList`. When all data has been read, it returns the `ArrayList`. Use [`BufferedReader.readLine`](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html#readLine()) to read the data in the file.  Use [`java.util.StringTokenizer`](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/docs/api/java/util/StringTokenizer.html) to parse the data.

   You can assume that every line in the file contains the data for exactly one employee in the following format:

   ```
   ID_name_salary
   ```

     where:

      - _ID_ is an integer that represents the ID of the employee.
      - _name_ is a String that represents the name of the employee.
      - _salary_ is a double that represents the salary of the employee.
   
   The fields are delimited by an underscore ( \_ ). You can assume that the fields themselves do not contain any underscores.
   
   The method `read` should _not_ contain try-catch blocks for the following exceptions. This requirement will simplify the code.
   
   - `FileNotFoundException`. Thrown by the `BufferedReader` constructor if the specified file does not exist.
   
   - `IOException`. Thrown by `BufferedReader.readLine` if an I/O error occurs.
   - `NoSuchElementException`. Thrown by `StringTokenizer.nextToken` if the specified file contains incomplete data.
   - `NumberFormatException`. Thrown by `Integer.parseInt` and `Double.parseDouble` if the specified file contains invalid data.

4. **Implement** the method `write` **(10 points)**: 

   It first creates a [`PrintWriter`](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.html) object for writing data to the specified file (if the file does not exist, one will be created). It then writes the ID, name, and salary of each employee in the specified `ArrayList` to the specified file. Every line in the file should contain the data for exactly one employee in the following format:

   ```
   ID_name_salary
   ```

   where:

   - _ID_ is an integer that represents the ID of the employee.
   - _name_ is a String that represents the name of the employee.
   - _salary_ is a double that represents the salary of the employee.
   
   The fields are delimited by an underscore ( \_ ). 
   
   The order of the employees in the file should match the order of the employees in the `ArrayList`. If the specified file exists, its contents should be erased when it is opened for writing. The method write should _not_ contain a try-catch block for the following exception. This requirement will simplify the code.

     - `IOException`. Thrown by the `FileWriter` constructor if the specified file could not be found or created.


### Submission
Upon completion, submit **only** the following.
1. *EmployeeFileIO.java*, *EmployeeFileIO.class*
2. a word file including the program running results

## Exercise 2: File I/O in the Gourmet Coffee

**(30 points)**

### Prerequisites, Goals, and Outcomes
**Prerequisites:** Before you begin this exercise, you need mastery of the following:
- _Java API_
  - Knowledge of the class `StringTokenizer`
- _File I/O_
  - Knowledge of file I/O
    - How to read data from a file
    - How to write data to a file

**Goals:** Reinforce your ability to use file I/O

**Outcomes:** You will master the following skills:

- Produce applications that write data to a file

### Background
In this assignment, you will create another version of the _Gourmet Coffee System_. In previous versions, the data for the product catalog was hard-coded in the application. In this version, the data will be loaded from a file. Also, the user will be able to write the sales information to a file in one of three formats: plain text, HTML, or XML. Part of the work has been done for you and is provided in the student archive. You will implement the code that loads the product catalog and persists the sales information.
### Description
The _Gourmet Coffee System_ sells three types of products: coffee, coffee brewers, and accessories for coffee consumption. A file called catalog.dat stores the product data:
- [_catalog.dat_](https://www.icarnegie.com/content/SSD/SSD3/4.2.0.0/normal/pg-adv-class-impl/pg-io-prgrmng/assm-exer-file-io/pool-pr-io-prgrmng/qn-pr-io-gou-cof/handout/catalog.dat). File with product data
  Every line in catalog.dat contains exactly one product. A line for a coffee product has the following format:

  ```
  Coffee_code_description_price_origin_roast_flavor_aroma_acidity_body
  ```

  where:

  - "Coffee" is a prefix that indicates the line type.

  - _code_ is a string that represents the code of the coffee.

  - _description_ is a string that represents the description of the coffee.

  - _price_ is a double that represents the price of the coffee.

  - _origin_ is a string that represents the origin of the coffee.

  - _roast_ is a string that represents the roast of the coffee.

  - _flavor_ is a string that represents the flavor of the coffee.

  - _aroma_ is a string that represents the aroma of the coffee.

  - _acidity_ is a string that represents the acidity of the coffee.

  - _body_ is a string that represents the body of the coffee.

    The fields are delimited by an underscore ( \_ ). You can assume that the fields themselves do not contain any underscores.

  A line for a coffee brewer has the following format:

  ```
  Brewer_code_description_price_model_waterSupply_numberOfCups
  ```

  where:

  - "Brewer" is a prefix that indicates the line type.

  - _code_ is a string that represents the code of the brewer.

  - _description_ is a string that represents the description of the brewer.

  - _price_ is a double that represents the price of the brewer.

  - _model_ is a string that represents the model of the coffee brewer.

  - _waterSupply_ is a string that represents the water supply of the coffee brewer.

  - _numberOfCups_ is an integer that represents the capacity of the coffee brewer in number of cups.

    The fields are delimited by an underscore ( \_ ). You can assume that the fields themselves do not contain any underscores.

  A line for a coffee accessory has the following format:

  ```
  Product_code_description_price
  ```

  where:

  - "Product" is a prefix that indicates the line type.
  - _code_ is a string that represents the code of the product.
  - _description_ is a string that represents the description of the product.
  - _price_ is a double that represents the price of the product.

  The fields are delimited by an underscore ( \_ ). You can assume that the fields themselves do not contain any underscores.

The following class diagram highlights the elements you will use to load the product catalog and persist the sales information:

**Figure 1** _Portion of Gourmet Coffee System class diagram_

In this assignment, you will implement `FileCatalogLoader` and complete the implementation of `GourmetCoffee`.
#### Interface `CatalogLoader`
The interface `CatalogLoader` declares a method for producing a product catalog. A complete implementation of this interface is provided in the student archive.

_Method:_

- `Catalog loadCatalog(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException, DataFormatException`

  Loads the information in the specified file into a product catalog and returns the catalog.
#### Class `DataFormatException`
This exception is thrown when a line in the file being parsed has errors:
- The line does not have the expected number of tokens.
- The tokens that should contain numbers do not.
A complete implementation of this class is provided in the student archive.
#### Class `FileCatalogLoader`
The class `FileCatalogLoader` implements interface `CatalogLoader`. It is used to obtain a product catalog from a file. You should implement this class from scratch:

_Methods:_

- `private Product readProduct(String line) throws DataFormatException` 

  This method reads a line of coffee-accessory data. It uses the class `StringTokenizer` to extract the accessory data in the specified line. If the line is error free, this method returns a Product object that encapsulates the accessory data. If the line has errors, that is, if it does not have the expected number of tokens or the token that should contain a double does not; this method throws a `DataFormatException` that contains the line of malformed data.

- `private Coffee readCoffee(String line) throws DataFormatException`

  This method reads a line of coffee data. It uses the class `StringTokenizer` to extract the coffee data in the specified line. If the line is error free, this method returns a Coffee object that encapsulates the coffee data. If the line has errors, that is, if it does not have the expected number of tokens or the token that should contain a double does not; this method throws a `DataFormatException` that contains the line of malformed data.

- `private CoffeeBrewer readCoffeeBrewer(String line) throws DataFormatException`
  This method reads a line of coffee-brewer data. It uses the class `StringTokenizer` to extract the brewer data in the specified line. If the line is error free, this method returns a `CoffeeBrewer` object that encapsulates the brewer data. If the line has errors, that is, if it does not have the expected number of tokens or the tokens that should contain a number do not; this method throws a `DataFormatException` that contains the line of malformed data.
- `public Catalog loadCatalog(String filename) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException, DataFormatException`

  This method loads the information in the specified file into a product catalog and returns the catalog. It begins by opening the file for reading. It then proceeds to read and process each line in the file. The method [String.startsWith](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#startsWith(java.lang.String)) is used to determine the line type:
    - If the line type is "Product", the method `readProduct` is invoked.
    - If the line type is "Coffee", the method `readCoffee` is invoked.
    - If the line type is "Brewer", the method `readCoffeeBrewer` is invoked.

  After the line is processed, `loadCatalog` adds the product (accessory, coffee, or brewer) to the product catalog. When all the lines in the file have been processed, `load` returns the product catalog to the calling method. 

  This method can throw the following exceptions:

  - `FileNotFoundException` â€” if the specified file does not exist.
  - `IOException` â€” if there is an error reading the information in the specified file.
  - `DataFormatException` â€” if a line in the file has errors (the exception should contain the line of malformed data).

#### Class `GourmetCoffee`
A partial implementation of class `GourmetCoffee` is provided in the student archive. You should implement `writeFile`, a method that writes sales information to a file:
- `private void writeFile(String fileName, String content) throws IOException`

  This method creates a new file with the specified name, writes the specified string to the file, and then closes the file.
#### Class `TestFileCatalogLoader`
This class is a test driver for `FileCatalogLoader`. A complete implementation is included in the student archive [_student-files.zip_](https://www.icarnegie.com/content/SSD/SSD3/4.2.0.0/normal/pg-adv-class-impl/pg-io-prgrmng/assm-exer-file-io/pool-pr-io-prgrmng/qn-pr-io-gou-cof/handout/student-files.zip). You should use this class to test your implementation of `FileCatalogLoader`.

## Exercise 3: Swing GUI of Gourmet Coffee System

**(20 points)**

### Prerequisites, Goals, and Outcomes
**Prerequisites:** Before you begin this exercise, you need mastery of the following:
- _Graphical user interface (GUI)_
- Knowledge of Swing components and containers

**Goals:** Reinforce your ability to create a GUI using Swing 

**Outcomes:** You will master the following skills:

- Produce applications that use a Swing GUI

### Background
In this assignment, you will create a GUI that displays the _Gourmet Coffee System_&#39;s product catalog. Part of the work has been done for you and is provided in the student archive. You will complete the code that creates a graphical presentation of the product details.
### Description
Class `CatalogGUI` lets the user display the product details of every product in the gourmet coffee store&#39;s product catalog. This simple GUI contains the following components:
- a `JList` that displays the product code of every product in the catalog
- a `JPanel` that presents product details
- a `JTextArea` that serves as a status area
To examine the details of a particular product, the user selects the product code in the list. The application responds by displaying the product details in the `JPanel` and a status message in the `JTextArea`.



![b.jpg](https://i.loli.net/2019/09/17/Krd7f3c4S2ABPjx.jpg)

**Figure 1** _Execution of CatalogGUI_

The following class diagram highlights the classes used to implement the GUI:

![c.jpg](https://i.loli.net/2019/09/17/WFuD5sYT2tj3Xwm.jpg)

**Figure 2** _Portion of Gourmet Coffee System class diagram_

Class `CatalogGUI` instantiates the Swing components, arranges the components in a window, and handles the events generated by the list. In this assignment, you will implement the method `getDataFieldsPanel` that returns a `JPanel` displaying the product details. An incomplete implementation of `CatalogGUI` is provided in the student archive.

Class `DataField` contains a name/value pair that represents a single attribute that is stored within an object. A complete implementation of `DataField` is provided in the student archive.

Classes `Product`, `Coffee`, and `CoffeeBrewer` have been enhanced to add a method called `getDataFields` that returns an `ArrayList` of `DataField` objects with the product details:

- In class `Product`, the method `getDataFields` returns an `ArrayList` with `DataField` objects for the attributes "code", "description" and "price".

- In class `Coffee`, the method `getDataFields` returns an `ArrayList` with `DataField` objects for the attributes "code", "description", "price", "origin", "roast", "flavor", "aroma", "acidity" and "body".

- In class `CoffeeBrewer`, the method `getDataFields` returns an `ArrayList` with `DataField` for the attributes "code", "description", "price", "model", "waterSupply" and "numberOfCups".

  A complete implementation of classes `Product`, `Coffee`, and `CoffeeBrewer` are provided in the student archive.

Class `Catalog` has been enhanced: it now contains a method called `getCodes` that returns an array of product codes (all the product codes in the product catalog) which `CatalogGUI` uses to populate the `JList`. A complete implementation of `Catalog` is provided in the student archive.

### Tasks
The following steps will guide you through this assignment. Work incrementally and test each increment. Follow Sun&#39;s code conventions. Save often.
1. **Extract** the files from student-files.zip

2. **Then** , complete the implementation of the method `getDataFieldsPanel` in the class `CatalogGUI`.

  `private JPanel getDataFieldsPanel(ArrayList<DataField> dataFields)` 

  Returns a reference to a `JPanel` object that shows the names and values of the `DataField` objects stored in the parameter `dataFields`:

   - For a coffee product, `dataFields` contains nine `DataField` objects with the names: "Code", "Description", "Price", "Origin", "Roast", "Flavor", "Aroma", "Acidity" and "Body".
   - For a coffee brewer, `dataFields` contains six `DataField` objects with the names: "Code", "Description", "Price", "Model", "Water supply" and "Number of cups".
   - For a generic product, `dataFields` contains three `DataField` objects with the names: "Code", "Description" and "Price".

  For each `DataField` object stored in `dataFields`, the `JPanel` should contain a JLabel object with the name of the attribute and an uneditable `JTextField` object with the value of the attribute. Use the `JPanel` layering technique to build the `JPanel`. The arrangement of the `JPanel` need not match Figure 1 exactly; any well-organized presentation of the attributes will be acceptable.

3. **Finally** , compile and execute the class `CatalogGUI`.

### Submission
Upon completion, submit **only** the following.
1. *CatalogGUI.java*, *CatalogGUI.class*
2. a word file including the program running results
